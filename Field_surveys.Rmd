# Introduction {#fs-intro}

This notebook illustrates procedures and methods for conducting field surveys and for collecting and curating physical samples. This is the practical, field-based side-of-things, which provides the data links between survey designs and procedures for field observations, experiments and physical measurements of e.g., rock, water, soil, plant and/or livestock fecal samples. While field survey activities are expensive to implement, they also provide particularly high information values for any subsequent cropland management decisions. So, it is very important to plan and execute the associated field activities carefully. We can think of field surveys, sample collections and experiments as occurring in 5 steps:

1. Delineation of a geographical Region of Interest (ROI).
1. Drawing up a spatially representative sample of locations from within the RoI, considering any potential field crew safety factors ... first-and-foremost!
1. Setting up of standard field observation, measurement and/or experimental protocols that work digitally with e.g. [KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org) or other [ODK](https://opendatakit.org/) resources.
1. Conducting the field sampling and collecting the needed georeferenced observations, measurements, and physical samples.
1. Sample processing and data curation.

The associated activities should be carried out in sequence; but, the actual variables that are captured during field surveys can be changed as different experimental or monitoring priorities emerge over time. This notebook covers the initial 5 steps and include example data for Tanzania, R-code and the relevant links to external open-source resources for survey activities.

# Delineating a Region of Interest {#roi}

This notebook describes setting up a field sampling plan that provides representative spatial coverage over any given landscape or [Region of Interest (ROI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_interest). Selecting an ROI for ground sampling is a critical step, because it determines both the main and recurrent costs of any adaptive mapping or monitoring program as well as the resulting precision and accuracy of inferences and predictions that are made about that ROI. A geograhically consistent field sampling plan should therefore always be defined in terms of the immediate needs and constraints of the mapping and monitoring tasks at hand, but within a long-term planning context. 

The notebook provides an example that is based on the need for physically sampling representative *"Cropland"* areas of all of Tanzania. By *Cropland* we actually mean the *"Managed and cultivated areas"* as per the relevant [FAO LCCS](http://www.fao.org/3/x0596e/X0596e02.htm#TopOfPage) definitions. Also see the corresponding [ISO 19144](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:19144:-2:ed-1:v1:en) specifics. 

The ROI calculations for this example are shown in the R-chunks presented below. Note that Cropland and Building occurrences are based on comprehensive GeoSurveys, which were conducted between 2018 and 2020 to map *Croplands* in Tanzania. The data and set-up needed for this exercise are also found below. A seperate notebook for how the GeoSurvey's were done and analyzed is available at [GeoSurvey]().

You'll need the following [R-packages](https://cran.univ-paris1.fr/web/packages/dplR/vignettes/intro-dplR.pdf) to run this example.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  require(downloader)
  require(rgdal)
  require(raster)
  require(BalancedSampling)
  require(leaflet)
  require(htmlwidgets)
})
```

The data for running the example are accessible via the following:

```{r}
# create a data folder in your current working directory
dir.create("TZ_sample", showWarnings=F)
setwd("./TZ_sample")

# download current Tanzania GeoSurvey predictions
download("https://osf.io/fdkz8?raw=1", "TZ_GS_preds.zip", mode="wb") ## download from OSF
unzip("TZ_GS_preds.zip", overwrite=T)
glist <- list.files(pattern="tif", full.names=T)
grids <- stack(glist)

# download GADM-L3 shapefile (courtesy: http://www.gadm.org)
download("https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhefsc8u120uqwp/TZA_adm3.zip?raw=1", "TZA_adm3.zip", mode="wb")
unzip("TZA_adm3.zip", overwrite=T)
shape <- shapefile("TZA_adm3.shp")
```

# Drawing up a sampling plan {#samp-plan}

Next is the sample plan setup and a working definition of the region of interest (RoI). Note that apart from the cropland area mask for Tanzania, we have also included a GeoSurvey-based "distance to buildings" covariate. By neccessity, cropping and other land management activities are closely associated with the presence of buildings and humans. 

From a practical perspective this variable is also included because of the typically extreme logistics and potential hazards to field crews associated with collecting samples in remote, unpopulated locations. However, one can always change the `bd` (distance to buildings) variable in the chunk directly below to accommodate any other specific sampling frame coverage requirements. For example, you could also use additional variables such as slope steepness or other accessibility constraints where needed.

```{r}
# create a ROI image based on cropland mask and distance to nearest buildings grids
cp <- 1    ## set cropland mask to 1 (cropland present)
bd <- 0.5  ## set maximum sampling distance to the nearest "buildings" (in km)
roi <- overlay(grids, fun=function(x) 
{return(ifelse(x[1] >= cp && x[2] <= bd, 1, 0))})

# extract ROI coordinates
coord <- coordinates(roi)
index <- extract(roi, coord)
index <- as.data.frame(cbind(coord, index))
rmask <- index[which(index$index == 1),]
```

This provides a plot of the ROI, and extracts the needed spatial coordinates of the sampling frame. Note that these constraints are intended to keep the ROI within a generally accessible range for field surveyors (by car, motorcycle or on foot).

The subsequent chunk then then sets up the layers for drawing a spatially balanced trial location sampling frame from the ROI. We use the `overlay` and `lcube` functions from the `raster` (to create the ROI) and `BalancedSampling` (to sample the ROI) libraries in R [(R Core Team)](https://cran.univ-paris1.fr/web/packages/dplR/vignettes/intro-dplR.pdf) to draw a spatially representative sample. The method implements the cube method of [Deville and Tillé (2004)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/91/4/893/459329?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which allows sampling based on the relevant inclusion probabilities while aiming for balance and spread with respect to speciﬁed covariates and/or constraints. 

```{r}
# set sampling parameters
N <- nrow(rmask)        ## ROI/population size (in 250 m pixels)
n <- round(N/16*0.1,0)  ## set the sample size (the number of proposed sampling locations)
p <- rep(n/N,N)         ## calculates the inclusion probabilities

# draw geographically balanced sample
set.seed(6405)                      ## sets repeatable randomization seed
B <- cbind(p, rmask[,1], rmask[,2]) ## specifies balancing variables
rsamp <- cube(p, B)                 ## samples from the RoI/population using the cube method
```

In this particular example, sample sites were selected purely for spatial balance, which entails that the mean coordinates of sample sites are close to the mean coordinates of all points in the sample frame and have adequate spatial spread. This ensures that the observations are spread out rather than clustered with respect to the spatial coordinates, see [Grafström and Schelin (2014)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BalancedSampling/index.html). The following chunk performs those calculations:

The proposed location coordinates and `GID` can be exported as a GPS readable file (see the options at e.g., [GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org)), with which survey crews can navigate to the planned locations in the field.

```{r}
# extract sample coordinates
x <- rmask[rsamp,1]
y <- rmask[rsamp,2]
xy <- data.frame(cbind(x,y))

# Define unique grid ID's (GID)
# Specify pixel scale (res.pixel, in m)
res.pixel <- 10000

# Grid ID (GID) definition
xgid <- ceiling(abs(xy$x)/res.pixel)
ygid <- ceiling(abs(xy$y)/res.pixel)
gidx <- ifelse(xy$x<0, paste("W", xgid, sep=""), paste("E", xgid, sep=""))
gidy <- ifelse(xy$y<0, paste("S", ygid, sep=""), paste("N", ygid, sep=""))
gid <- paste(gidx, gidy, sep="")
xy <- cbind(gid, xy) ## attaches a grid ID (10*10 km) to the respective sample locations

# attach GADM-L3 and above unit names from shape
coordinates(xy) <- ~x+y
crs(xy) <- "+proj=laea +ellps=WGS84 +lon_0=20 +lat_0=5 +units=m +no_defs"
sloc <- spTransform(xy, CRS(proj4string(shape)))
gadm <- sloc %over% shape
sloc <- as.data.frame(sloc)
samp <- cbind(gadm[ ,c(5,7,9)], sloc)
colnames(samp) <- c("Region", "District", "Ward", "GID", "lon", "lat")
write.csv(samp, "TZ_sample.csv", row.names = F)
```

Note that the grid ID variable `GID` as well as administrative unit names such as `Region, District & Ward` in this example are useful for planning the logistics of the field surveys. However, we recommend that `GID` should be the primary spatial georeference point on any given field survey day. 

You can also generate a zoomable map of the proposed sampling locations with the `leaflet` package. This may help further with navigation and survey planning.

```{r}
# render map
w <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = mean(samp$lon), lat = mean(samp$lat), zoom = 4) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.Mapnik) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(samp$lon, samp$lat, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
w ## plot widget 
```

# Setting up cropland geotagging and physical sampling protocols {#os-protocols}

After careful GeoSurvey interpretations (see at: [GeoSurvey data prediction workflows](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/VXC97), we currently use  to sample, observe, measure, and ground-validate the distribution of cropping systems, crop types and to collect georeferenced and time stamped physical (rock, soil, plant, livestock) samples and any other data that are relevant to adaptive cropland management interventions (e.g., the presence of soil erosion features and/or irrigation and soil conservation structures). They can also be used for registering various crop management trials.

Ground- survey activities are generally *stop-and-measure* based, meaning that any observations and measurements (O&M) are done when you stop your car, motorbike or walk-in and do your observations and sample collections over a predefined area and record their georeference. As long as the underlying sampling frame that is used to determine locations is geographically representative of a given ROI, these data are suitable for generating unbiased, georefenced estimates of use-cases for crop distribution modeling, predictive soil and plant nutrient mapping, crop yield monitoring, agricultural input monitoring, electrification, mechanization and irrigation potentials and the development of environmental impact assessments.

You can also use similar protocols for geotagging any rock, soil, plant and livestock biomarker samples at the locations that you visit. All physical samples should receive *Universally Unique IDs* that are embedded in [QR-code labels](https://tag.qed.ai/sheet/) for each sample, which are tagged with metadata and the relevant O&M in the field. This process also allows tracking any sample through various (MIR, XRF and/or wet chemistry) laboratory processes and to curate physical samples at your laboratory sample storage facilities.

You will need to print soil or any other physiscal sample labels. These are generated as machine-readable paper on the basis of a UUID (or universally unique sample ID). The reason for having a unique machine-readable label is to be able to decisively track any given sample that is collected from the field, through the subsequent laboratory processes, and into the corresponding databases. Batches of QR code labels can be generated for printing at: [TAG](https://tag.qed.ai/sheets). The physical labels will look something like the example shown below depending on how they are actually printed on the sticky label paper.

```{r QR_label, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Example QR-code sample labels.", out.width = '50%', }
knitr::include_graphics("figures/QR_label.png")
```

## You will need the following equipment and materials:

1. An Android smart phone or tablet.
1. A separate GPS device (optional, but highly recommended for field navigation).
1. At least one soil auger marked with colored tape at 20 and 50 cm from the tip.
1. 2, 20-liter plastic buckets.
1. A 5-liter plastic jerry can for water.
1. A rope or cable marked with colored tape at 2.82, 4.61 and 5.64 meters.
1. Sturdy, recyclable ~1-2 liter plastic containers for each rock/soil/plant/livestock sample.
1. Sticky QR code labels, 2 for each sample container (see above).

## Before you go into the field:

1. Install the needed ODK forms. To use the ODK soil sample login form you initially need to install the following applications on your Android device (phone or tablet): Use the following link to [KoBoCollect](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/kobocollect-android.html) for detailed instructions. 
1. something like [XZing]() barcode scanner (to read QR code labels on your device).
1. something like [GPS Essentials]() (if you are going to be using your phone or tablet for field navigation rather than a separate GPS unit).

You can locate the needed apps on Google Play by searching for them by name. Note that you will need an Internet connection for this. Once you have installed the software on your Android device: start [KoBoCollect]() and then set the server address that will link you to the relevant forms: General Settings > Server. The General Settings menu can be accessed by tapping the <left> menu button on your device. 

* Don???t worry about entering a Username or Password. They are not needed.
* Set the URL field to e.g.: http://??.

This allows you to download blank forms for use on your Android device. It also allows you to save any completed forms to a database on the KoBoToolbox server. To download the blank ODK Soil sample form to your device, follow these 3 steps:
